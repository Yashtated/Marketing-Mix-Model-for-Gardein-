- **Tools:** R for data cleaning, transformation, and regression modeling (see `Conagara-Project-Final.R` and `Predictive-Analytics-R-Script.R`).

## Strategic Recommendations

### Expanding Product Portfolio

- Launch Gardein products in missing categories to capture unmet demand and broaden consumer appeal.
- Focus on high-potential segments, where Gardein already has a foothold but can increase share.[1][5][9]

### Regional Penetration

- Invest in marketing and distribution in underperforming but high-potential regions.
- Tailor products and promotions to regional preferences and meal occasions.[1]

### Pricing Strategy

- Maintain value-based pricing for premium products, with targeted promotions and digital coupons to attract new consumers.[8]
- Monitor price elasticity: If demand is inelastic, modest price increases may boost revenue; if elastic, focus on volume growth through competitive pricing and promotions.[1][8]
