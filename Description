This project leveraged advanced data analytics techniques to improve the market share of Conagraâ€™s Gardein brand in the plant-based protein market. I employed trend analysis, competitor analysis, and SWOT analysis 
to gain insights into market dynamics. I utilized segmentation analysis to categorize products by flavor and type, optimizing the marketing mix. Regression analysis was a core technique, enabling to 
create predictive models that assessed the impact of macroeconomic factors, pricing strategies, and geographic variations on sales. These models informed targeted recommendations for pricing adjustments, 
flavor introduction, and distribution expansion, aiming to enhance Gardein's market position.
